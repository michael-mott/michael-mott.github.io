     Who am I?
   </h2>
      <p> Hello, I grew up in the Methow Valley in Winthrop, Washington.
        I was born in Vancouver Canada, and will always consider myself a Canadian.
        Growing up, sports and the outdoors were a major part of my life.
        Choosing a university was difficult for me because
        I was stuck between being close to my siblings on the east coast of
        Canada or being around the mountains on the west coast of Canada. </p>

       Schooling
    </h2>
    <p> I eventually chose to attend the
      University of Victoria in Computer Science. It allowed me access to the
      beautiful outdoors.I am in my first year at the university and are
      taking two courses in python, and took an AP class in Java in high school.
